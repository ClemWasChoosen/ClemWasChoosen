# Hello there üñê

I'm Cl√©ment, a French student in 2nd year of a Master degree based in Strasbourg.
My first goal is to become a Data Scientist, so, I do everything I can to achieve this. 

## Some data about me 

```javascript
const clement = {
    preferencies: ["Coding 'til goals achieved", "Working at night", "Remote work", "Light Mode"],
    aboutMe: ["Enthusiastic data science master's student", "Passionate about artificial intelligence", "Proficient in Python, C, JavaScript, and more"],
    code: ["Python", "C", "Javascript", "Web Langages", "VBA", "Vim", "Always eager to learn new technologies"],
    education: {
        bachelor: "Computer Science",
        bachelorLocation: "Strasbourg, France",
        bachelorThesis: "Completed a Bachelor's degree with a focus on computer science.",
        master: "Data Science and Machine Learning",
        masterLocation: "Strasbourg university",
        masterStatus: "Currently pursuing a Master's 1 year degree in Data Science and Machine Learning.",
    },
    technologies: {
        dataScience: {
            languages: ["Python"],
            frameworks: ["TensorFlow", "PyTorch"],
            tools: ["Jupyter Notebook", "Pandas", "NumPy", "Matplotlib"],
            concepts: ["Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", "Natural Language Processing"]
        },
        tools: {
            languages: ["Vim", "tmux", "Obsidian", "etc..."],
            concepts: ["Advanced Text Editing, terminal and other"]
        }
    },
    currentFocus: "Working on a projet of machine learning for my school",
    funFact: "I started my coding journey after witnessing a dog enter my favorite bar, look around, and 'bark': Hello World."
};

```

Working alone on a project entails self-learning üëæ.

I simply love crafting, learning, and getting better. Feel free to reach out with any questions; I don't bite üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
