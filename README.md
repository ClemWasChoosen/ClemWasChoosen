# Hello there 🖐

I'm Clément, a French student in 3rd years of "Licence Informatique" based in Strasbourg (equivalent to BSc Computer Science).
My first goal is to become a Creative Web developer, so, I do everything I can to achieve this. 

## Some data about me 

```javascript
const clement = {
    preferencies: ["Coding 'til goals achieved", "Working at night", "Remote work", "Light Mode"],
    aboutMe: ["Creative Web development", "React 💖", "app dev"],
    code: ["Javascript", "Html", "Css", "C", "VBA", "Everything new that I can learn"],
    technologies: {
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["Gsap", "React", "Three.js", "LocomotiveJs"]
        },
        backEnd: {
            js: ["Node", "Express"]
        },
        mobileApp: {
            native: ["React Native"]
        },
        databases: ["PostGreSql"]
    },
    currentFocus: "Web page for my sister creation",
    funFact: "I started coding when I saw a foo walks in my favorite bar, looks around and bark: Hello World"
};
```

Working alone on a project implies to learn graphism (Figma, Adobe XD), software development thinking (UML, draft paper, Notion, Skiff, ...) 👾

I just love creating things, learn and become better. For any kind of question, don't be shy, DM me 🧛‍♀️
